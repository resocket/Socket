### Quickstart

In this guide, we will set up a reconnecting WebSocket with heartbeats (ping/pong). We will also explore its configurations

<Callout type="info">
  **React Quickstart** - if you want to use socket in a react app. you can take
  a look at the [React Quickstart](/socket/react)
</Callout>

#### Pre requisite

you should have a local or remote websocket server that you can connect to, please take a look at [this guide](todo) to setup a websocket server

#### Installation

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab key="npm" label="npm">
    ```bash 
    npm install @resocket/socket 
    ```
    
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab key="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    ```bash 
    pnpm install @resocket/socket 
    ```
    
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab key="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash 
    yarn add @resocket/socket 
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Setup

Socket is mostly compatible with the standard WebSocket API. so you can just use it how you'd use a normal websocket

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

// WebSocket server endpoint
const ServerUrl = "ws://localhost:8000";

/**
 * create a new Reconnecting Websocket
 * it will automatically reconnect if the connection drops
 */
const socket = new Socket(ServerUrl);

// Listen for messages from the WebSocket server
socket.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  console.log(e.data); // Logs the WebSocket message
});

/**
 * subscribe to the connection status changes
 * this is useful if you want to add connection status indicators
 */
socket.addEventListener("status", (status) => {
  console.log(status); // Possible values: 'connecting', 'reconnecting', 'connected', 'closed', 'disconnected'
});
```

---

#### HeartBeat (Ping/PONG)

You can easily add heartbeats to your connection with a simple configuration. The example below configures a heartbeat every 30 seconds, ensuring the connection remains active and responsive.

```ts
import { Socket, type SocketConfig } from "@resocket/socket";

// WebSocket server endpoint
const ServerUrl = "ws://localhost:8000";

// WebSocket protocols (optional, use an empty array if not needed)
const SocketProtocols: string[] = [];

// Socket configuration
const config: SocketConfig = {
  /**
   * add heartbeats to your connection
   * this will send a heartbeat (ping/pong) every 30 seconds
   */
  heartbeat: 30000, // 30 seconds
};

const socket = new Socket(ServerUrl, SocketProtocols, config);
```

### Authentication

Here's one of a few ways you can add authentication to your Websocket connection using the `params` option.

`params` takes a function that should return an object or a Promise that resolves to an object. this object then is added to the query param of the websocket connection url.
you can use `params` as follows.

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   * Whatever you return from this function will be added as an queryParam to the connection url
   *
   * in our case we return the token,
   * ws://localhost:9000/?token=${TOKEN_VALUE_THAT_WAS_RETURNED_FROM_THIS_FUNCTION}
   */
  params: async () => {
    const token = await MyAuthProvider.getToken();

    return {
      token,
    };
  },
});
```

### Connection Timeouts

you can also add custom connection timeouts for both your `param` function and for the connection itself.
here's the following config

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   * if your params function takes longer than
   * the paramsTimeout, then it'll automatically fail
   * and move to retry
   */
  paramsTimeout: 10000, //10 seconds - default is 10 seconds

  /**
   * if your websocket connection takes longer than
   * the connectionTimeout, then it'll automatically fail
   * and move to retry
   *
   * note: connectionTimeout is started after the params function resolves and socket is starting it's connection
   */
  connectionTimeout: 10000, //10 seconds - default is 10seconds
});
```

### Closing Websocket Connection

There are many ways to close the websocket connection both from the server and the client. in this section we will look the configurations and options related to closing the websocket connection.

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   * Your socket will not reconnect. if the server closes the websocket connection
   * with any of the closeCodes that you provide to the config.
   *
   * server side - you can call something like socket.close(4000)  <- this is example server code
   */
  closeCodes: [4000], //example value:  [4001, 4002] - defaults to []

  /**
   *  Your socket will move to a failed state (disconnected state)
   *  after 10 consecutive failed attempts to connect
   */
  maxRetries: 10, //default is infinity
});

/**
 * Calling socket.close()  will also stop your websocket connection
 * the connnection will not try to reconnect if you call close.
 *
 * after calling .close() the connection will only reconnect when you explicitly call socket.reconnect();
 */
socket.close();
```

#### StopRetry

Sometimes you may also want to stop the retry from the `param` function.
for example if the user doesn't have the correct permissions or some other business logic
you can do this by throwing a `StopRetry` error.

```ts
import { Socket, StopRetry } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  params: async () => {
    const hasPermissions = await MyAuthProvider.hasPermissions();

    /**
     * We're throwing a StopRetry error here
     * this will automatically tell Socket to not reconnect
     * and we will move on to failed/disconnected state
     *
     */
    if (!hasPermissions) throw new StopRetry("You're not authorized");

    //retrurn whatever auth data or any other data you want here
    return {};
  },
});

/**
 * You can catch the stop retry error on disconnect here
 * it'll be either CloseEvent, ErrorEvent, StopRetry or undefined
 */
socket.addEventListener("disconnect", (e) => {
  if (e instanceof StopRetry) toast(e.message);
});
```

### Customize Reconnection Delays

there are many ways to customize your websocket reconnection and retries. in this section we will look at the configuration related to reconnection and retries.

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   * you can set the reconnection delay grow factor config option
   * this let's you control how fast the reconnection delays grow
   *
   * delay = minReconnectionDelay * Math.pow(reconnectionDelayGrowFactor, retryCount)
   */
  reconnectionDelayGrowFactor: 1.3, //default value - 1.3

  /**
   * your socket will have atleast the minReconnectionDelay
   * before trying to reconnect
   */
  minReconnectionDelay: 2000, // Default - (1000 + Math.random() * 4000)

  /**
   * your socket will at max wait for maxReconectionDelay
   * befoer trying to reconnect
   */
  maxReconnectionDelay: 4000, // Default - 10000 (10 seconds)
});
```

#### getDelay()

sometimes you may want to add custom delays based on your application logic. you can do this with `getDelay` option.

<Callout type="warning">
  using `getDelay` will override the following config methods.
  `minReconnectionDelay`, `maxReconectionDelay`, `reconnectionDelayGrowFactor`
</Callout>

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  getDelay: () => {
    //you can return your custom delay here
    return Math.random() * Math.random();
  },
});
```

### Customize Heartbeat

in this section we will take a look at all the config options related to heartbeats.

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   *  sends a heartbeat on focus events.
   *  will ignore focus events if set to true
   *
   *  note: only applicable if heartbeatInterval is set
   */
  ignoreFocusEvents: true, //default false

  /**
   *  sends a heartbeat on network offline events.
   *  will ignore network events if set to true
   *
   *  note: only applicable if heartbeatInterval is set
   */
  ignoreFocusEvents: true, //default false

  /**
   *  maximum number of consecutive missed ping messages
   *  before the connection is moved to reconnect
   *
   *  note: only applicable if heartbeatInterval is set
   */
  maxMissedPings: 2, //default 1

  /**
   * the amount of time to wait for server to respond to the ping message
   *
   *  note: only applicable if heartbeatInterval is set
   */
  pingTimeout: 2000, //default 3000 (3 seconds)

  /**
   * the ping message to send to the server
   *
   *  note: only applicable if heartbeatInterval is set
   */
  pingMessage: "PING", //default "ping"

  /**
   * the pong message to recieve from the server
   *
   *  note: only applicable if heartbeatInterval is set
   */
  pingMessage: "PING", //default "pong"
});
```

### Buffering

Socket has default support for buffering. and exposes options to make it easier to add custom buffering for your application.

config 1

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   * this buffers the message if the connection is dropped
   * and sends all the messages upon reconnection
   */
  buffering: true,
});
```

config2

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   * this buffers the message if the connection is dropped
   * and sends all the messages upon reconnection
   *
   * this will drop the message from buffering if the messages increase the
   * maxEnqueuedMessages threshold
   */
  buffering: { maxEnqueuedMessages: 100 },
});
```

custom buffering

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";

let buffer = [];

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/");

/**
 * send buffered message on connect
 */
socket.addEventListener("open", () => {
  buffer.map((message) => {
    socket.send(message);
  });

  buffer = [];
});

/**
 * buffer the message if socket is not ready
 */
if (socket.canSend()) {
  socket.send("message");
} else {
  buffer.push("message");
}
```

### LostConnection Toast

this option allows you to handle situations where the connection is lost and does not reconnect within a specified time frame.

You can use this hook to notify users of connection issues, such as through toast notifications. This hook is triggered with the following events:

- `"lost"`: When the connection is lost and reconnection attempts are ongoing.
- `"restored"`: When the connection is successfully reestablished.
- `"failed"`: When the connection cannot be restored (rare).

You can configure the timeout for the lostConnectionTimeout option (default is 5 seconds):

```ts
import { Socket } from "@resocket/socket";
import { toast } from "some-toast-library"; //add your toast library here

const socket = new Socket("ws://localhost:9000/", [], {
  /**
   * sets the lost connection timeout
   */
  lostConnectionTimeout: 10000, //defaul to 5 seconds
});

socket.addEventListener("lostConnection", (event) => {
  switch (event) {
    case "lost":
      toast.warn("Still trying to reconnect...");
      break;

    case "restored":
      toast.success("Successfully reconnected again!");
      break;

    case "failed":
      toast.error("Could not restore the connection");
      break;
  }
});
```
