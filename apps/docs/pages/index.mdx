## ðŸŽ‰ Resocket

At Resocket, we're creating devtools for real-time and multiplayer applications. We're actively looking for early adopters and design partners to help shape the future of our tools.

Weâ€™ve just released our first open-source package:

[Socket](https://github.com/resocket/socket) â€” a better reconnecting WebSocket library for everyone, focused on enhancing developer experience.

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FQb86Sqxhd) server for early updates, getting early access, and to connect with the Resocket community.

Weâ€™re also open to business collaborations. If you're interested, reach out to us at shibru127@gmail.com.
